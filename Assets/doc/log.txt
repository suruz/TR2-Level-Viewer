Parser class Modularization through dependency analysis and unit test. Discarding externally dependent members...
7/16/2014
Performing CRC analysis with class Level, MeshBuilder, TextureUV.

Level: 
Level Manages prefab and instantiated game objects, rooms, actor, static objects. This class uses helper class 
MeshBuilder, TextureUV e,t,c

MeshBuilder:
Generates unity mesh from tr2 mesh.

TextureUV:
An utility class for texture manipulation.

CRC using existing class:
When analyzing mesh builder member function input, main input should correspond to an existing tr2 mesh. 
Function should be helper in nature that will serve an entity type, not an ID. ID is not finite in nature and context sensitive. Example:

CreateStaticObject(Mesh mesh, Vector3 position, Quaternion rotation, string name) 

Here, Parameter should be Mesh type, not an ID type. ID type would restrict wide use of CreateStaticObject() ID is 
bound to a specific context, such as an valid array of mesh. Here, CreateStaticObject() is not sensitive to such 
array bound.

Extending tr2 base class...
Attaching custom properties to cloned unity object. One way to do this is assigning a object containing custom 
properties as a variable to MonoBehaviour script of that cloned object and then initialize the cloned object and it's component with that variable.
Example:

public class GameObjectEx: MonoBehaviour 
{
	public ClassData data; // data holding custom properties

	void Start()
	{
		//perform runtime initialization like animation clip setup
           //with data
	}

}

An Note On CRC:
A class does not need to know about another class, unless it’s task requires it. It will enforce strict 
responsibility of a class. For example, an event system does not need to know how the event will be handled 
and where.


An object based approach for a game engine

    GameObject* objects[]
	GUIElement* elements[]
	Player* player
	Window* window
	while (true) 
	{
	// read player input
	if (key == DOWN) {
	update player's position
	}
	if (joystick is moved) {
	update player's position
	}
	// update each object belonging to the game objects
	for (each game object) {
	do physics simulation
	do AI
	}
	// render each object belonging to the game objects
	for (each game object in objects[]) {
	Window->render(object)
	}
	// render each GUI element
	for (each game element in elements[]) {
	if (element has been updated) {
	Window->render(element)
   }
   
   }
   }
   
What we got is a God object, a well known anti-pattern. As we add more features to our game, maintaining such 
all-knowing objects becomes a bottleneck of the project. It is also worth noting that when doing rendering, 
the renderer needs to go through all the game objects to know which objects have been updated. The same applies 
to the GUI elements. We don't use Observer pattern, so we can not notify the renderer about individual updates 
as soon as they happen.

Handle SFX with animation
   
The highest level of these is the SoundMap[] array, which translates the internal sound index into an index into 
SoundDetails[]. Each SoundDetails record contains such details as the sound intensity, how many samples to select 
from, and an index into SampleIndices[]. This allows for selecting among multiple samples to produce variety; 
that index is the index to the SampleIndices[] value of first of these, with the rest of them being having the 
next indices in series of that array. Thus, if the number of samples is 4, then the TR engine looks in 
Sample Indices[] locations Index, Index+1, Index+2, and Index+3. Finally, the SampleIndices[] array references 
some arrays of sound samples. In TR1, these samples are embedded in the level files, and SampleIndices[] contains 
the displacements of each one in bytes from the beginning of that embedded block. 

In TR2 and TR3, these samples are concatenated in the file "MAIN.SFX" with no additional information; 
SampleIndices[] contains sequence numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, ...) in MAIN.SFX. Finally , the samples themselves are 
all in Microsoft WAVE format. 
   
   
   typedef struct { // 2 bytes
    bit16 Value;
    } tr2_anim_command;

Here are all the AnimCommand opcodes and their operands:
// 1: 3 operands. Position reference: (x,y,z); found in grab and block-move animations
// 2: 2 operands. Position reference on surface for jumping: (x,z) for horizontal and (y,z) for vertical surfaces(?)
// 3: No operands. Not clear; occurs in animations that are "slaved" to other animations, such as Lara throwing switches or moving blocks.
// 4: No operands. Not clear; occurs in some death and settling-down animations, but not all.
// 5: 2 operands. The first one is a frame number, and the second one is the ID of the sound to play at that frame (internal sound index).
In TR2 and TR3, one of the sound indices two highest bits may be set; when they are, their meanings are

0x4000 -- play this sound when on dry land (example: footsteps)
0x8000 -- play this sound when in water (example: running through shallow water)

Trapdoor not working! Help!

You have placed a trapdoor object covering a door to the room below. You have placed a switch to it, all works ok, 
but in game when the trapdoor is closed it is not solid and Lara go through it.
For trapdoors and similar objects you have to do an additional step to make them solid stand-able, you have to 
put in the solid sector below the trapdoor object a TRAPDOOR trigger with the command Item(x) where x is the 
trapdoor object you are making solid.

Realize engine architecture.

Elegant way to using Game Engine is to use its query mechanism. Engine maintains a list of Objects with component. 
Why not let engine handle them. Push Object to engine and If anything to know ask it for that. Let’s extend room 
objects with MonoBehabiour component holding important room info. Let’s convert RoomEx in to Monobehabiour. Let’s 
limit Responsibility of Level class as component object factory and passing them to engine.

Learned: It takes time to make an update which has measurable cost!

Define Player Events:
OnPositionChanged()
OnSectorChanged()
OnRoomChanged()
CanHandlePrimaryAction() 

Smartly determine possibility(Grab Ledge, Pull self up, Pull Push block e.g.) analyzing surface geometry

Physics Generated events:

case is going to idle state;


9.21.2014
Updating AnimationStatePlayer! Mostly cleanup tasks! All Physics handlers are moved to Player Class. Now 
AnimationStatePlayer is just a view of Player class. Added Event for Animation states that Player class will handle. For example, OnJump event. Collision checks are mostly done on movement events. That’s a great saving against continuous collision check!

FIXED: Lara is initially in negative height position in some level. but mistakenly her initial setup height 
position was 0. So while landing (without ground collision check!) Lara was trying to reach 0 position 
her assumed landing position!). Which is higher than her initial jump position? This was giving floating on 
air error.

   
FIXED: Every transform that gets hit in room by Lara is not room transform.

Write algorithm to detect ladder step (platform) and find highest step from triangle network.

First select a triangle from triangle network
Then find a edge that is normal to ground. 
      If normal direction going upward than this triangle does 
         not have platform edge.
           Look for diagonal edge. 
           Select another triangle sharing this diagonal edge 
           Where selected triangle does not share any other vertex
           from base triangle except vertex on diagonal edge.
      else Select third vertex of triangle that does not lie 
           on normal  edge.
           Select highest vertex along normal edge. 
           Connect it with third vertex to create platform edge.
           Select another triangle sharing this platform edge 
           where selected tri does not share any other vertex 
           from base triangle execpt vertex on platform edge. 
           Calculate curvature along edge. If it is flat then run 
           the whole procedure again

FIXED: Get back to free position bug. Actually last freeposition must recorded unconditionally after every

FIXED: Ladder Step Detection algorithm

  First, select a face from face network
  Then, find a edge that is normal to ground. 
				
  If normal going upward and found next edge diagonal - > go to mirrored face.
  If normal going upward and found next edge horizontal - > Next edge ladder step
                                                    -> if ladder step found check it is topmost go to mirror face.

  else

  If normal going downward and found next edge horizontal - > go to mirror face.
  If normal going downward and found next edge diagonal - > third edge is ladder step
                                                  -> if lader step found check it is topmost go to mirror face 

10.3.2014
FIXED: Stand position after pulling self up on a Block. Unfortunately, I added Block height with last hanging 
height (of foot). In fact it will be hanging height (of foot) + body height, so that stand position is exactly 
on top of block.
Note:  Pivot point is Lara's foot.  

New Bug: Flickering after height adjustment!! 
When pull up animation going there is difference between foot position
and actual pivot position. Difference remains at the end of animation. When we try to reposition pivot to expected 
foot position, model body is translated to new height. When animation is reset or new animation is applied, pivot
gets back to actual position. This back and forth translation causes Flickering.

Checked for valid tr2 file type on level load by checking file version! Otherwise returned to Level Load Screen 
with massasge.Added Last Loaded Level path to Player Pref with last successfull level load! Checked if directory 
exsists or empty.

FIXED: SetRoomForPlayer() in class level. Downward raycast was unable to hit room plane. Because raycast origin 
was started on room plane. Setting raycast origin slight above room plane solved the problem.Same error could 
happen in PositionChanged() in Player class.

Thinking to create custom wrapper class as raycast utility handle ground hit ditection by player.

Changed Class name AnimationStatePlayer to LaraStatePlayer. It was handling specially Lara's animation state changes.
So I though it would be right naming and intutive also :)

Most of the AI should inherit a common visibility function. May use ray cast to determine proximity of player.

Some thoughts that made me sleepless :)
Software should mean softlywared, meaning loosely coupled and detachable when required by other.Because people
may not be intersted to system as a whole, they could be interested some donatable self sufficient part of system.
Thats the perspective of object orientation should be I think.

Best practice of objec orientation could be acheived by reusibility improvment, instead of practicing
differented implementation (or reinventing the wheel) all the time. For example, here I used totally
different camera for door opening, where funtionality like smooth movement that I implemented in main camera
is missing. Instead of implementing whole functionality for scratch, why not reuse main camera handler.

Now question of improvment practice come here. Develope main camera handler such that it could be open
for reusibility and extention.

Moved BuildAnimationStateMap() utility function LaraStatePlayer class to its own AnimationStateMapper class.
This is more meaningful.

Determined swmimming sates in water using water surfce and room info. In the process
I had to fix bug in Parser.Tr2RoomInfo(), It was a typo bug while parsing
Parser.Tr2RoomInfo. This bug was giving wrong Parser.Tr2RoomInfo.yTop. As a result
it was creating problem in water room depth measurement.

Updaing LaraStatePlayer.cs to add new layers in Lara's state machine, to support her 
polymorfic action at various depth in water.

Layers:
Normal
Shallow water movement(idle, 177 wading, 192 jump up transition)
Inwater movement   (108 idle, 86 swim, jumpx, 130, 206 pickup)
water surface movement (110 idle, 116 move,jumpx, pullup)

Select shallow layers
if lara in water filled room && Lara's hip < room surface height

Debug.Log("Anim ID: inwater swimming " + "86" + " " + "State ID:" +  tranimations[86].stateid);    //17
		Debug.Log("Anim ID: inwater idle " + "108" + " " + "State ID:" +  tranimations[108].stateid);    //13

We need fluid transition swmimming state and normal movement.

state transition we should handle:
1. water dive (in shallow water, in deep water).
2. pull up (from deep water).
3. walkup (from shallow water).
4. deep water to shalow water movement( vice versa), considering underwater surface and wall collision system allowing free swimming


we need adjust follow camera allowing third persion under deep under water swimming view, where forward and back will controll character tilt,
jump will thurst character forward


Fixed unable to change height in deepwater swimming due to addition height fix in Update, this height fix could be easily done by
standard free fall algorithm.

 if (m_SwimState != SwimmingState.InDeepWater)
 {
        float h = Mathf.Lerp(transform.position.y, m_GroundHeight, Time.deltaTime * 10.0f);// + 0.1f;

 Devloping shader for underwater caustic effect.
 shader works by taking center point of the room and modifing
 vertex according to distance of vertex from center. 
 generates spherical uv coord by normalizing vertex, generate lat-long
 values using normalized vertex.

 Adding new method RoomEx.GetCenterPoint() to support vertex modulation in
 shader.
 
 Calculating center point in  RoomEx.Init()

 Note: Vertex shader input data provide vertex stream in model space...

 9/11/2017
 
 modified under water vertex normals using world space vertex distance from world center, thus avoided
 need to model space center per under water mesh. now it is also possible to use shared material for
 underwater mesh.

 conditional vertex modification... based on _InSideWater shader property.
 During creation of level _InSideWater is set to 0

 RoomEx.GetCenterPoint() now provide room center position in world space. It helps to determine
 water plane Y position. Used this value for vertex modification bellow/over water surface. 

ThirdPersonCam.CheckCameraInWater() determines _InSideWater value, Also added Level.GetWaterHolderMaterial() 
for easy access of shared under water surface material.

Swim state layering is done inside LaraStatePlayer based on original movement state + m_SwimState,
In early version Player.cs was modified input state-code for layering, which was kinda hack!


11/13/2017

Removed  call back PrimaryAction of LaraStatePlayer. this call back lets player.cs return proxy state code
to LaraStatePlayer. Instead of originating this call back in LaraStatePlayer and then handling in player.cs,
PrimaryAction call is wraped in  player.cs on StateCodeHandler.

Fixed pull up height calculation bug due to Lara's pivot position change in different swimming event
(e.g, pivot on head during water surface movement)

TODO:

- define Wall hit test variable 

- use Wall hit test flag to make system wait for end of existing state excution

- variable for raycast length
- wrap primary action handler for primary action in different swim state

possible issue could be OnStandingUp() ->  FlickerPos = new Vector3(t.position.x, PullUpTarget.y + m_JumpHeight, t.position.z);

Use common wrapper method for raising custom state code. but problem is  m_AnimStatePlayer.StateCodeHandler is not easily customizable
    void FireStateCode(int keystate, int otherkey, float time)
    {
        if (m_AnimStatePlayer != null)
        {
            m_AnimStatePlayer.StateCodeHandler(keystate, otherkey, time);
        }
    }


Renamed Player.JumpTarget as JumpVector for better meanning

Added Common movement checker method Player.IsInMovement()

	Remapped KeyMapper.cs to allow more actions (e.g. free fall, diving into water)
	TODO:
	- Compose jump physics using normal jump and free fall ( another word detect falling part of jump physics)
	- Change falling animation depending on current fall displacement

	Devloping diving state machine....

	156-158 (will dive)
	153 (diving)
	152 (did dive)
	87 (did dive)

	Fixed double instances of Lara in some TRLE level. This casued movement speed issue while updating player.


	25/11/2017

	Fixed diving into water bug due to early return of Player.SetSwimState() while checking m_bJumping == true
	Dont goto swimming state again while worling against gravity (e.g trying to getout of water), except case, jumping into water.

	Fixed animation frame rate using original engine time per frame.

	27/11/2017

	Entity relative frames are sum of frames  in all animation clips in Entity (e.g. Lara)

	Added method LaraStatePlayer.SelectDispatcher() to select proper dispatcher for state change based on
	entity relative frame index. current unity animation clip frame index is converted to entity relative 
	frame index.

	Updated TRAnimationClip class to support clip space frame index to entity space frame index

	Fixed: jump tumble bug by performing post ground seeking in Player.JumpingHandler(), pre ground
	seeking causing bug due to the fact that, seeked ground level is higher than player's y positon
	player will not jump;

	28/11/2017
	
	Added method Loader.BuildLevel....

	Added class LevelManager to manage serialized level data (e.g Materials),
	Initially I tried to serialize public data inside LevelManager through
	a static method. but static variables in monoderived class can not be serialized,

	So I took object based approch, I created a level manager game object with component
	<LevelManager> in Loader.BuildLevel, then initialized (or serialized)  LevelManager's 
	public variables.




	From now on all material data will be access through LevelManager

	Now room data is accessible through inspector (e.g room type)


	30/11/2017

	Moved underwater camera check method ThirdPersonCam.CheckCameraInWater()  to LevelManager.CheckCameraInWater()...
	Also CheckCameraInWater is done depending on a flag m_bCameraInWater, instead of continueous checking for performance...
	Removed component WaterEffect from water surfaces while level build, instead a global Water Effect Controller is used for performance...
	
	Added class SoundMananger to manage SFX and ambient background sound...
	Added Component SoundMananger to Main Camera, which addes Audio source to camera to handle distance independent sfx.
	
	Used main camera as sfx aduio source for distance independent sfx

	RoomEx.m_RoomBound is made public for serialization of room bound in case of edit mode level build...


	8/12/2017
	Handled outof index bug in SetupTrigers
	Handled null refference exception in PrimaryActionHandler

	9/12/2017
	updated water filled room material selection logic in Level.cs. 

	  if ((leveldata.Rooms[i].Flags == 0x0001) || (leveldata.Rooms[i].Flags == 65) || (leveldata.Rooms[i].Flags == 585)) //Is room water holder
      {
		// Generate material instances for water holder using m_SharedMaterialWaterHolder
	  }


	Segment terrian water surface using room bellow bound.
	Create room normally. but keep room flag.
	if room flag is 65 then look room above it
	clip all triangles of room above using current room bound

	The original portal testing algorithm performs a breadth-first visibility check of the bounding boxes of the screen-projected portal vertices,
	and also compares the vector from the camera to the first portal vertex to its normal. This works pretty fine, unless there are denormalized
	bounding boxes, which the original TR solves by expanding the portal bounding box to its maximum if a projected edge crosses the screen 
	plane or its boundaries.

	In some TRLE levels attributes of room vertices  is set to zero. So alternative is using room visibiliy portal or room bounding box.

	A room could have multiple adjecent portals, use horizontal portals only ( note: horizontal portal normal lies in horizontal plane in TR)

	Warning: scaling could be potential issue, when you dont realize that some value is already scaled, 
	for example calculation was giving wrong scaled result,

		m_PortalPolygon[i] = new Vector3(port.Vertices[i].x , m_CenterPoint.y, port.Vertices[i].z ) * Settings.SceneScaling;

	where correct one will be,
	    m_PortalPolygon[i] = new Vector3(port.Vertices[i].x * Settings.SceneScaling, m_CenterPoint.y, port.Vertices[i].z * Settings.SceneScaling);

	during previos calculation I didnt care that, m_CenterPoint.y is already scaled  by  Settings.SceneScaling !


	[Water surface exclusion algorithm]

	- Added method RoomEx.GetWaterPortal() to get portal polygon for water room
	- Exclude all faces in portal if face has alpha texture
	    
		    - Mark horizontal faces with alpha
			- Mark Outer and inner boundary of alpha region
			- Separate faces within marked boundary

	used  surface motion (e.g. texture animation on face) to flag surface as water.
	not all animated surfaces are water although (e.g lava flow), so faces with normal
	along world up vector is probale candidate of water surface.

	optimization: consider following face atrribute checking....

	     if (has_water)
                {
                    if (IsFaceInWater(is_water_vertex, Idx0, Idx1, Idx2, Idx3) )
                    {
                        continue;
                    }
                }
                else
                {
                    if (IsFaceInWater(leveldata, Rectangles[rectCount].Texture))
                    {
                        continue;
                    }
                }


     with this one....

     if(IsFaceInWater(is_water_vertex, Idx0, Idx1, Idx2, Idx3) && has_water)
                {
                    continue;
                }
                else
                {
                    if(IsFaceInWater(leveldata, Rectangles[rectCount].Texture))
                    {
                        continue;
                    }
                }


	 which one perform best in a loop?

	 Logical error In surface-diving condition:  Float without dive

	 Bug: FreeFallHandler() can not detect ground change,ground height is continuously updated, 
	 but last-ground-height seems to be not updated properly
